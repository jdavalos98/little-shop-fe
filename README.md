### Learning Goals:
We were trying to work on our CSS abilities and Active Record query methods as thorough as possible. 
All of us were able to partcipate in doing all aspects of the project.

### Wins + Challenges:
We feel really good about how things turned out. Getting the testing to work across our spec tests as well as the required tests in Postman was a big challenge.
If we had more time, our front end layout would be a bit more stylish, but overall we feel like we succeeded given our time constraints.
